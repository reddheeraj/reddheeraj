# Hello, I'm Dheeraj! 👋

I'm almost done with my MS Degree (Data Science) at Texas A&M University, and I'm currently building & exploring Multi-Agent systems, NLP, MCPs, and a lot of Software Engineering principles :) My main forte is still ML, NLP and, well, Data Science. Things keep changing, as I was working on Computer Vision and Agentic Simulations @ Amazon, and NLP & Deep Learning @ Mahindra Group. Anyway, glad you're here!
